# Part I: Performance Measurement of your favorite Key-Value Store

### For Part I, I will be exploring the popular in-memory keyâ€“value database Redis.

Originally developed by Salvatore Sanfilippo, Redis is currently the most widely used Key-Value store system in the world according to [db-engines.com](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking). It was implemented in C and thoroughly optimized to provide high speed and low latency making it a great candidate for used as a cache, message broker or even general-purpose database. Throughout this part, I will install Redis, use it to load data and benchmark its performance with datasets of different sizes.

### 1. Installation

The following installation steps are meant a machine running MacOS. If your machine is following a different operating system, please refer to the official Redis documentation at https://redis.io/topics/quickstart.

- **Install Homebrew**:

Homebrew is a Package Manager for MacOS (or linux) that makes it easier to install programs and packages. To install it, open the terminal and run the following command:

```shell
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)" 
```

- **Install Redis**:

After installing Homebrew, simply run the following command in the terminal to install Redis:

```shell
    brew install redis
```

You should see the following messages on your terminal:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/redis-shell-1.png" width="65%" height="65%" class="center"/></div>

- **Test Redis**:

Check which Redis version was installed (should be the most updated version):

```shell
    redis-server --version
```

Start the Redis service. By default, redis runs on port 6379, but this could be changed in the redis configuration file redis.conf located at /usr/local/etc/:

```shell
    brew services start redis
```
    Start the redis-cli and test the connection:

```shell
    redis-cli
    ping
```

If you recieve a response saying "PONG", you properly installed Redis in your machine. You can quit from the cli by running:

```shell
    quit
```
